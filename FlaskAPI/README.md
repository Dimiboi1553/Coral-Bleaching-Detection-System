# Coral-Bleaching-Detection-System
This Script by its self wont work as the trained AI is around a 1GB in size therefore I cant upload it to. But, if you would like to have it work train the model using the Colab Script I have and put in the same file as the rest of the other scripts and name it 'FinishedModel.h5' for it to make the predictions.
